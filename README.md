# 🍷 Cousin Vino's Drink Calculator

Welcome to **Cousin Vino's Drink Calculator**—a handy dandy tool that helps you plan the perfect event by calculating how many drinks you'll need based on guest preferences, event size, and duration.

# 📖 Story Time

As a wine shop part-timer, one of our responsibilities is helping folks plan events. At every shop I've worked at, I've always noticed how long it takes and how confusing it can be to figure out how many bottles to buy. I built this tool to help out my team and other stores in my area, so we can focus on the fun stuff, picking out the drinks! Cheers!

- Adjust drink preferences dynamically with percentage sliders and inputs.
- Takes bottle size and pack size into consideration.

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
